AI Chat Assistant UI - Remix, Vite, Supabase

Overview:

Create a clean and intuitive web app UI for an AI Chat Assistant using Remix, Vite, and Supabase. The goal is to provide a seamless chat experience with an app launcher that grants access to various tools like Workbooks, Knowledge Graph, etc.

Key Features:

Primary UI: The chat interface occupies the full right-side window by default.

App Launcher: Hidden by default, appears when clicked (similar to Googleâ€™s app launcher).

Tool Selection: Once a tool is selected, it replaces part of the chat space, while the chat remains visible.

Visual Representation: Each tool is represented by an image icon + name (no text shortcuts like WB, KG).

Mock Data: Use JSON files for now.
